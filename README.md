# DHCP-Server-and-Client

## Collaborators
David Expósito López and Ángela Sánchez Robles from class 2 ASIR BIL.

## Introduction
The objective of this practice is to configure a DHCP server on a Linux machine and set up two clients to obtain their network configuration automatically. One client (c1) will be configured to obtain a dynamic IP from a specific range, and the other client (c2) will always receive a fixed IP address based on its MAC address.
