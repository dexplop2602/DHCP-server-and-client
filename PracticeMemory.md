# TECHNICAL LOG: DHCP Server Configuration (Completed & Debugged) üöÄ
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# This document details the full procedure, including the environment setup,
# troubleshooting steps, and final file export for the DHCP practice.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 1: üèóÔ∏è Virtual Environment Setup (Vagrantfile)
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The foundation of the practice is the Vagrantfile, which defines the VMs and their networking.
# The following configuration was used:

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
   config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"

   # Server DHCP
   config.vm.define "server" do |server|
     server.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.10"
     server.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.57.10", virtualbox__intnet: "dhcp-net"
   end

   # Client 1 (IP Dinamic)
   config.vm.define "c1" do |c1|
     c1.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "dhcp-net", type: "dhcp"
   end

   # Client 2 (IP Static for MAC)
   config.vm.define "c2" do |c2|
     c2.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "dhcp-net", type: "dhcp", mac: "080027000002"
   end
 end

# EXPLANATION:
# - Server: Has two network cards. One for management (192.168.56.10) and one for the
#   internal, isolated network 'dhcp-net' (192.168.57.10) where it will serve IPs.
# - Client c1: Connects to 'dhcp-net' and is configured as a DHCP client.
# - Client c2: Same as c1, but we assign a specific MAC address ('080027000002').
#   This MAC is the key to assigning it a fixed IP later in the DHCP server configuration.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 2: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launching the Virtual Environment
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# With the Vagrantfile in place, the environment was launched.
vagrant up


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 3: ‚öôÔ∏è Server Setup and Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration of the 'server' machine.

# Connection via SSH:
vagrant ssh server

# Identification of the internal network interface ('enp0s9') with:
ip a

# Installation of the DHCP service:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y isc-dhcp-server

# Configuration of the listening interface in '/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server'.
# The 'INTERFACESv4' directive was set to:
INTERFACESv4="enp0s9"


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 4: üîß DHCP Service Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Definition of the DHCP network parameters.

# A backup of the original configuration was created:
sudo cp /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.bak

# The main configuration file '/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf' was edited with this content:
subnet 192.168.57.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.57.25 192.168.57.50;
  option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 4.4.4.4;
  option domain-name "micasa.es";
  option routers 192.168.57.10;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.57.255;
  default-lease-time 86400;
  max-lease-time 691200;
}

# Syntax was checked, and the service was restarted and its status verified.
sudo dhcpd -t
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 5: ‚úÖ Client 'c1' Verification
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# We verified that 'c1' obtained a dynamic IP correctly.
# Server logs confirmed the DHCP transaction (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK).
vagrant ssh c1
ip a
# On server: grep dhcpd /var/log/syslog


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 6: üìå Static IP Assignment and Debugging for 'c2'
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The static IP assignment was added to '/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf' ON THE SERVER.
host c2 {
  hardware ethernet 08:00:27:00:00:02;
  fixed-address 192.168.57.4;
  option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1;
  default-lease-time 3600;
  max-lease-time 7200;
}

# The service was restarted on the server. Verification on 'c2' required troubleshooting.
# NOTE: The following commands and checks were performed on the 'c2' machine.

# ISSUE 1: Client 'c2' kept its old dynamic IP or had two IPs.
# CAUSE: The client had a valid DHCP lease and did not request a new one automatically.
# SOLUTION: The most effective solution was to restart the VM to force a clean DHCP request.
# This command is run from the host machine:
vagrant reload c2

# After reloading, verification with 'ip a' on 'c2' showed the correct fixed IP: 192.168.57.4.

# ISSUE 2: '/etc/resolv.conf' showed nameserver 127.0.0.53, not 1.1.1.1.
# CAUSE: Modern Ubuntu uses systemd-resolved, which acts as a local DNS proxy.
# SOLUTION: The correct DNS server was verified using the appropriate command on 'c2'.
resolvectl status
# This command's output confirmed that the DNS server for the enp0s8 interface was correctly set to 1.1.1.1.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# STEP 7: üìÇ Exporting Configuration Files
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The final step was to copy the configuration files to the host machine.

# ISSUE: The 'vagrant scp' command was not found.
# CAUSE: The command is provided by a plugin, which was not installed.
# SOLUTION: The plugin was installed on the host machine.
vagrant plugin install vagrant-scp

# With the plugin installed, the files were successfully copied.
vagrant scp server:/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf .
vagrant scp server:/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server .
